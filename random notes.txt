Playing with typescript, and ive decided to create the UI first (to make testing a bit easier), so that mucks up my schedule a bit. Mainly doing this so I can get a chance to learn TypeScript a little better before I try adding things like data or XML lookups. There will be an app script file, and a core script file - which will be the "API" i had previously described. Propbably gonna spend the next few days just thinking about this in the background - lost of student senate and RHA stuff ahead.

Trying to figure out how to read databases from JavaScript/Typescript. It is....problematic. At the same time, I don't want to be using a giant JSON file containing all of this data to be validated - but that might be what I end up doing.



4:26 PM 4/18/2021 - about 4 hours

So I have the UI (basically) done. And I'm still not sure how to do the data file containing the classes, but I am running super short on time. Probably gonna just do a JSON with everything - even though I hate the idea. Probably not doing much the next few days - lots of work to do for the senate, RHA, and my CIS602 class has the final paper due on friday, so I might need to turn in what I have at this point for the "Lessons Learned" portion later on, and use the time before I present to shore things up.

Note to self: Never trust Dell to meet a shipping timeline, even if you pay them extra to ensure that it happens.

Trying to catch up on things, both with this project and other things. Not much specific code was "created" for this - mostly playing with different ways to do things - probably two lists (as I had originally imagined) - one with the classes entered by the user, and one with a list of all classes. I had originally considered going at this backwards, but that doesn't pull requirements of requirements (if that happens), but having to loop through the allClasses list multiple times wouldn't be a huge impact in this instance - as its done client side, and will only likely do it no more than 6 times.

It has been a while, but life gets busy.
Figuring out how to format the data in, doing some digging into using CSV files in Javascript which....I hate all the solutions. I am probably going to use JSON, even though it isn't really designed to do that sort of thing. One huge advantage of this: no external libraries! Not even jQuery!



4:48 PM 4/29/2021 - 6 hours

Well now I am using jQuery. Only way I can reliably zip in the prerequisites file without redoing a bunch of unnecessary stuff. Also got the function to trigger and all that. All i have left is the actual calculation bits (which compared to what I have done so far should be easy). I don't think I will have time to prettify it since stuff is due tomorrow ðŸ˜“.

I give up on it, for now. I got it as far as iterating through the two lists to grab the prereqs from a set list - and it just doesnt enter that loop. I wrote a bunch about it and plan to explain in the powerpoint, but....not sure how well that will land
